Dr. Daniel Povey is a renowned research scientist in the field of speech recognition. Over the past twenty years or so, Dr. Daniel Povey has been constantly making magnificent contributions to the speech recognition community, making him one of the best known researchers in the field.

Dr. Daniel Povey is first known for his work on discriminative training of hidden Markov model-based speech recognition systems. The improved training methods proposed by Dr. Daniel Povey were among the most effective techniques for improving speech recognition systems at the time.

Dr. Daniel Povey is probably best known for his work on the open source speech recognition toolkit Kaldi. Kaldi was a byproduct of the 2009 summer workshop at the Center for Language and Speech Processing, the Johns Hopkins University, titled “Low Development Cost, High Quality Speech Recognition for New Languages and Domains”. Kaldi was officially released on May 14th 2011, and quickly became the best open source speech recognition toolkit. Since its initial release, Kaldi has been maintained and developed to a large extent by Dr. Daniel Povey.

To better develop Kaldi, Dr. Daniel Povey took a faculty job at the Center for Language and Speech Processing, the Johns Hopkins University since 2012, and has been devoting his time purely to developing Kaldi and advising students since then, until the recent termination by the Johns Hopkins University.

A lot of people know Dr. Daniel Povey's work on speech recognition, but only a few know him personally. There is this article on Zhihu (China's version of Quora) written by Dr. Daniel Povey's former student, which gives a better view of what kind of a person Dr. Daniel Povey really is. The article has been upvoted by thousands of readers. The original article was written in Chinese, and below we've tried our best to translate that into English.

>I’ve never seriously written an answer on Zhihu before. But this time since the topic relates to my advisor, I’ve decided to finally provide a carefully written answer. I’ll leave my name up there.

>For the record: I am Dan's first Ph.D. graduate.

>The most upvoted anonymous answer has provided a thorough description of the incident, which is consistent with what I’ve learned, so I’m not going to elaborate on the incident itself again. I’d like to write about Dan, Dan as a researcher, as an advisor, and as an ordinary person. I believe after learning more about who Dan is, people will likely have a better understanding of what really happened during the incident. I’d also like to take the chance to record some of my Ph.D. moments.

>####Workaholic
>For those people who have used Kaldi, most likely you also know that Dan is a workaholic. Dan’s family lives on the West Coast, but to better develop Kaldi, Dan spent 7 years in Baltimore (yes, I just realized it’s been 7 years!). Dan spend almost all his time developing Kaldi every day, except for eating and sleeping. Of course, sometimes he also sings a song, or plays keyboard. I believe he works more than 14 hours a day.

>When I first met Dan, Dan said “send me emails whenever you have questions, I’m almost always online.” Frankly I didn’t really take it seriously at the first place. Who would always be online? But I was quickly proven wrong. Most of my emails sent to Dan were replied within 5 minutes, throughout my entire Ph.D., no matter if it was a weekday or a weekend. Same happened to the emails sent to the Kaldi forum. Dan would reply almost all the forum emails (mostly asking for helps) as long as he was up and working. It was quite amazing that Dan was able to process all those emails efficiently. I started doing open source projects by myself later on, but I was never able to reply all the emails.

>While I was at Hopkins, a majority part of Dan’s work was to write Kaldi code. I just checked on Kaldi’s GitHub repository and by the time I checked Dan had already contributed millions of code to Kaldi, which does not include code that was written but was not submitted. Sometimes when we felt like we should finish something soon, we would sit in Dan’s office and write code together with Dan. There was a time when I was writing code in Dan’s office, Dan’s daughter skyped him to show him her latest paintings. Dan gave a few comments, said “Dad needs to get back to work.” He then closed Skype and started writing code like crazy again…

>But of course it is not just about diligent. Dan is very talented. From time to time, Dan would give ideas that sounded mediocre at the first place, but turned out to be very effective after implementation. I often feel that Dan was born for the field of speech recognition.
