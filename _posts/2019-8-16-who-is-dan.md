Dr. Daniel Povey is a renowned research scientist in the field of speech recognition. Over the past twenty years or so, Dr. Daniel Povey has been constantly making magnificent contributions to the speech recognition community, making him one of the best known researchers in the field.

Dr. Daniel Povey is first known for his work on discriminative training of hidden Markov model-based speech recognition systems. The improved training methods proposed by Dr. Daniel Povey were among the most effective techniques for improving speech recognition systems at the time.

Dr. Daniel Povey is probably best known for his work on the open source speech recognition toolkit Kaldi. Kaldi was a byproduct of the 2009 summer workshop at the Center for Language and Speech Processing, the Johns Hopkins University, titled “Low Development Cost, High Quality Speech Recognition for New Languages and Domains”. Kaldi was officially released on May 14th 2011, and quickly became the best open source speech recognition toolkit. Since its initial release, Kaldi has been maintained and developed to a large extent by Dr. Daniel Povey.

To better develop Kaldi, Dr. Daniel Povey took a faculty job at the Center for Language and Speech Processing, the Johns Hopkins University since 2012, and has been devoting his time purely to developing Kaldi and advising students since then.
