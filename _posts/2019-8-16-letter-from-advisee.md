We are Dr. Daniel Povey’s students. Over the whole incident involving Dr. Povey, we have seen a lot of unfair reports, but our voices were never heard. We feel the need to provide our perspective. Though among us there are still different opinions on Dr. Povey’s actions, we all agree to share the following points:

**Dr. Povey is an incredibly supportive advisor who works diligently and closely with his students.** With 20000+ citations, Dr. Povey is internationally applauded for his research contribution. Thanks to his generosity in making his work open-source, people from different parts of the world are able to access the state-of-the-art speech recognition technology for free. As our advisor, he is always available to give us adequate help with technical and non-technical issues, with his experience, insight and kind heart. There are almost 20 students and research fellows in his group, with various backgrounds, religions, nationalities, genders and races. None of us has ever felt discriminated or unsafe working with him. We work with our advisor everyday and the thought of him being violent has never crossed anybody’s mind.

**We believe Dr. Povey’s entering of Garland Hall was not politically motivated at all**, but just to protect the public property of the school and to protect the students' rights-to-work, both of which are his job responsibilities. Dr. Povey entered Garland Hall with the sole purpose of saving the CLSP (Center for Language and Speech Processing) servers consisting of more than 50 machines, thousands of CPUs and GPUs, holding hundreds of terabytes of data. The server room, located in the basement of Garland Hall where the month-long student protest was taking place, has the problem of over-heat for almost two years, and the protest happened right before an important NLP conference’s submission deadline, which made maintenance an urgent issue. Most importantly, we might lose years of work if servers went down, and we did lose hundreds of gigabytes of data! From the center-wide emails, we saw Dr. Povey became more and more anxious when the machines started to fail and he needed to physically reboot the machines in Garland Hall. He was very upset when he found out that the protesters had chained themselves to the doors in Garland Hall, and the university expected it could be weeks before the whole thing cooled down.

**We are very disappointed by the way the University has handled this incident**, including its incompetence in bringing workarounds for providing server access and student services timely, complete lack of transparency in the investigation, and the brutal treatment to Dr. Povey and constraints to his students. **First**, as far as we know, the University is fully aware of the overheating problem of the CLSP server room, but did nothing in the past two years. The University is also fully aware that there could be a huge impact on CLSP, especially students, if servers went down during the protest, but we did not see enough effort from their part to effectively address the emergency, even temporary solution is better than none. Had the university acted appropriately in the first place, none of this would have happened. **Second**, the lack of transparency in the investigation is appalling. During the investigation, no one from the investigation team has ever reached out to any one of us to ask about our perspectives or about the potential difficulties we would have without Dr. Povey. By now, we have not seen at least a report or an explanation on what happened on May 8th night, why didn't the school do anything before Dan went in, who should be responsible for this, or whether there is any punishment to those protesters. **Third**, the decision made by the University is premature or brutal. In the past three months, Dr. Povey was banned from any correspondence with us without the presence of other faculty, even when we have told the school we are badly in need of his advice regarding purely academic matters. Besides, it is too extreme to unemploy Dr. Povey and not to allow him to enter the campus forever, considering the lock-in protesters got 90% wrong in the first place. 

Right now with our adviser gone, the whole group is deeply frustrated. Dr. Povey is irreplaceable not only because of his research skills, but also because he has been advising us on our research for several years and is the only one who sufficiently understands the intricacies of our work to advise us. Now we are facing a lot of uncertainties during this difficult time. Besides us, a lot of CLSP students thanked Dr. Povey’s devotion to his duty as the system admin. In a broader sense, we believe the improper handling of the whole incident has led to a lose-lose situation, with CLSP and JHU losing one of their most important assets in our research field.
