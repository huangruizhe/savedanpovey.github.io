An open letter from Dan’s advisees.


We are PhD students of Dan’s. We have seen a lot of unfair report of the incident involving Dan in the last weeks, and feel the need to provide our perspective. Note that among us we also have different opinions on the whole thing, and we don’t necessarily agree with everything that Dan did. But the majority of us feels that the university did a very poor job handling this incident and some important aspect of this incident is overlooked by a lot of people.

1. A lot of people think Dan’s action of staging a counter-protest is politically motivated. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Of course, everyone has their political beliefs including Dan, but the only reason he chose to do what he did was because of our servers’ failure. As a matter of fact, Dan is always leaning liberal, and he even donated to Clinton’s campaign back in 2016. A little background: the servers that all students and faculty at CLSP (Center for Language and Speech Processing) use are located in the basement of Garland hall, where the student protest was taking place. We have more than 50 computers, 1000 CPUs and 140 GPUs, holding hundreds of terabytes of data, that are running experiments 24/7 by people from CLSP, and the only computing server for the majority of CLSP students (a small number of people can access COE machines but majority can’t). Besides his own research and advising his students, Dan also acts as the sysadmin of CLSP, and is responsible for the correct functioning of all machines, where issue occur quite frequently due to the large number of machines and that students, especially more junior ones, might abuse the computation power. When the incident occurred, it was approaching the EMNLP 2019 deadline, which is one of the most prestigious conferences in natural language processing, so any major system failure would have a huge impact on CLSP, especially students. Actually from the center-wide emails, we could easily see how Dan became more and more anxious when realizing that the machines started to fail and he needed to physically reboot the machines at Garland hall to fix the issues. He was extremely upset in his email when he found out that the protesters had chained themselves to the doors in Garland hall, and the university expected there could be weeks before the whole thing quieted down. 

2. We are very disappointed at the way that the university has shown in the investigation, on its complete lack of transparency, and the blatant double-standard the university has shown, and ridiculous constraints that Dan’s students had to follow when the investigation was carried out. 

    a) Immediately after Dan was put on administrative leave, we as Dan’s students were told that we were not allowed to contact Dan, even regarding purely academic matters. Dan has close to 20 graduate students, all of whom need his advising in our projects. At the time of the incident, 4 of us are close to graduating and needed Dan’s advice on their thesis; 6 are in year 1, and not yet senior enough to completely conduct research independently. Most students of Dan’s are international students, with only 3 of them being Americans. As an international student myself, I felt extremely alienated by this ridiculous constraint that the university put on us, and from talking to other people, I am definitely not alone in this. The university gave the reason that we couldn’t contact Dan is because Dan could “attack his students”, which is a ridiculous explanation that can’t be backed by any common sense. 

    b) As far as we know, none of the students of Dan’s was interviewed during the investigation process. The lack of transparency in the so-called investigation is appalling. Shortly after Dan was put on leave, we conducted a center-wide survey, and we had a lot of responses, most of which were supportive of Dan, including a lot of very liberal people from CLSP. But apparently, the opinions of people from CLSP, even Dan’s own students who Dan work with every day, do not matter. 
    
    c) We were extremely shocked to find out that Dan was fired by the university. Some of us acknowledge that Dan did do certain things that were problematic, but it was no way near the firing threshold. And at the same time, we have seen blatant double-standard in the way the university treated Dan and the student. It is clear that those protesting students broke trespassing laws, and some of them committed violence. They have greatly affect countless students in CLSP, and also numerous students who seek student service in Garland hall, including disabled students who need disability service for taking their finals, international students who are traveling back to their country and need a signature from the international office or they won’t be able to re-enter the US, and international students who need help from the international office in filling important forms so that they could renew their legal status in the US. We understand that the university can say they must have a higher bar for actions of their faculties than students, however, this distinct double-standard in the treatment to Dan and those students is too big, and in the decision-making process, the university seemed to completely ignored the fact that we were seriously impacted, both by those protesting students and also by Dan’s firing.

    d) Right now with our advisor gone, our group is in chaos. And it seems that the university completely forgot about us in providing the resources for us to go through this difficult time. The junior students needing advising didn’t hear from the university on how they can continue the research; the students who are graduating are not told if they can still schedule their defense normally. 

3. At the same time, the international students in Dan’s group, most of whom are from Asia, are being attacked by Hopkins students in a super popular JHU Facebook group consisting of 16000 people. “Continenal asians” were told to “eat shit” for defending Dan. They also post in the group that “continenal asians” [are] “being antiblack to gain proximity to whiteness“, and ridicule “continenal asians” for “only interacting with people who speak the same language”, and we were just wondering why was race brought in this. Is this the “tolerant culture” they represent?

4. We highly suspect that Dan has aspergers, which is actually quite common in computer science people, especially top-level ones. A number of us are also more or less on the autism spectral, and we are frequently being misunderstood by “normal” people for the way we think, for being “geeky”, and the simple “identify the problem and solve it” mindset. Dan doesn’t go to most of the seminars; is painfully shy when meeting people, even his students, so we communicate mostly in email only; Dan rarely go to group dinners with us, and the few times he did, he would usually try to finish the food in half an hour and left to go back to work. During the investigation, Dan was asked if he was “absolutely certain” that the people he brought with him wouldn’t fight back “no matter what happens”, and he shrugged, because it’s the same as asking him “You drive a car to the campus; are you absolutely certain that you won’t hit a Hopkins student with your car?” To a person with asperger, the answer is obviously “no” since nobody is “absolutely certain” about anything.
